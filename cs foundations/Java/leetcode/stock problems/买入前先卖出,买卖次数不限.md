难度:easy



Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```



## 题目分析

求最大收益, 可以交易多次, 但是每次买入之前, 手上持有的股票, 必须先卖出. (给出了前面n天的信息, 其实是完备信息博弈)

正确解法: 每次遇到当天比前一天高的情况, 就在前一天买入, 当天卖出. 这样能获得最大收益.

证明: 如果前一天比当天价格高,在前一天买入, 肯定是亏本的. 假设当天比前一天高, 如果当天不卖出, 等后面价格更高点再卖. 可能遇到下跌; 或者假设是上涨的, 也不会比在当天卖出, 再买入, 再涨到更高的时候再卖出收益高.

```
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int max = 0;
        for(int i=1; i<prices.length; i++){
            if(prices[i] > prices[i-1])
                max += prices[i] - prices[i-1];
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
